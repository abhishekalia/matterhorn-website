Sports Page
Under “Youth Sports Program"
We list mention “NAYS” and “NAYS Partnership” - Don’t we also sell youth sports to non-NAYS members?  I think we should downplay it a bit and just state we have a partnership with NAYS which demonstrates our commitment to the education of league directors, coaches and officials…or something like that.

Entertainment Page
Under "Access to All Entertainment Coverages Through Curated Markets” 
Please add “Accident and Accident Medical Expense” as a product.
